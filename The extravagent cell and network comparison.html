<p> While the cell project has been done for quite a few years in Mrs Chapman's class no one has ever compared a human cell to a professional network setup, thats exactly what I'm going to be doing with this website.</p>

<p> In an attempt to make this an informative page both about cells and about a pro network I'll be giving summaries of all compared parts and analogies for better understanding. </p>

<h2>Parts compared</h2>

 <ul class=”base-row”>  
 



 <li class="cell1"><div class="content1" >
 
<p> Server: A server is a key component in any pro network because of how versatile it is.  You can host websites, store media/documents, and even have a security system setup on a server.  So by definition what is a server?  A server is like any other computer except it can be given a set list of tasks to perform.   its the main part of the network because everyone needs to access it for one reason or another and depending on the situation it can be vital to a networks existence. This is why I've matched it up with the Nucleus of a cell. </p>

<p> Modem: A nucleolus is considered to be very important as it assembles ribosomes (network switch) A network modem is similar in the way that it decodes a signal and transmits/outputs it throughout the network in a useable form for all parts of the network to utilize.</p>

<li class="cell1"><div class="content3">

<p>Network Map: A network map can be made on any computer with the right set of tools.  Basically the servers, firewalls, and routers can all be run and monitored by a network map.  For example if you wanted to check how much storage was left in server 1 you wouldn't have to go to the network location.  Instead you'd simply log onto your computer and access the network map then log onto the server remotely and check it that way.  Although it isn't perfect I have matched network maps with DNA since the Network map makes decisions for the server almost like a controller.</p>

<p>Ethernet: Endoplasmic reticulum is at its core tubules and vesicles that go through out the cell making a path for protein.  Ethernet is just like tubules and vesicles except instead of proteins it provides and makes a pathway for wired internet connections</p>

<li class="cell1"><div class="content5">

<p> Firewall: A cell membrane is a physical separator from the cell and the outside environment.  The firewall acts the same way.  It acts as a security checkpoint/wall so that you can have only certain connections on your network if you feel a malicious user is trying to connect.  It can block both ethernet and wireless signals just like a cell membrane can block anything that seems like a threat.</p>

<li class="cell1"><div class="content6">

<p> Static IP:  A static IP is almost like a ticket to a roller coaster ride for a computer.  it allows the computer to send and receive wireless/wired signals from/to the network and also gives it access to NAS (network attached storage)such as a server or a firewall.  This to me is like a golgi body which also distributes a way of accessing the Cell. </p>

<p> Administrator:  Admins are very important to networks (MSHS's awesome admin being Glenn) They are the man running the machines.  They have control over all of the parts and computers I've just described.  They are in charge of maintenance to these large arrays of devices and keeping them in top shape.  I've compared admins to vacuoles because vacuoles do maintenance all over the cell and while the the analogy isn't the best admins and vacuoles are closely related in terms of the types of jobs they have to perform.  </p>

 <li class="cell1"><div class="content8">
 
<p>Networking Switch:  Networking switches take the internet provided by the router and scatter it into the various ports so that multiple users can utilize ethernet connections connected to the port.  This is just like Ribosomes, they arrange the strands of the amino acids for use all over the cell. </p>

<p> Router: Cytoplasm surrounds everything in the cell.  Without it the components of the cell would fall out of their natural places.  A router acts the same way to any network.  It supports all of the parts of the network I've described above and below without it the network would just be a bunch of really loud computers with no actual function.</p>

<p> Failsafe Switch: Imagine a power outage like the one that happened last week.   Well as annoying as they are they can be hazardous to Servers and network setups.  A common problem is blowing capacitors when the power goes out but with a failsafe switch it is activated when a change in voltage occurs (and it can be switch activated)it shuts down all components of your network safely so no harm is caused to them.  They do this by breaking down the fuse so power cannot reach the component like a Lysosome breaks down all types of biological polymers.</p>

<p> Power Supply/UPS: A mitocondria converts energy to where its useable for the cell.  A Power supply does the same thing and is in every computer.  Power supplies work fine when there is electricity but what happens when the power goes out?  Well this is when a UPS plays a role.  It acts as an external mitocondria supplying battery power to crucial components (if the failsafe switch hasn't been activated) </p>
